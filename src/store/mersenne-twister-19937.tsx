  I've wrapped Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura's code in a namespace
  so it's better encapsulated. Now you can have multiple random number generators
  and they won't stomp all over eachother's state.
  
  If you want to use this as a substitute for Math.random(), use the random()
  method like so:
  
  var m = new MersenneTwister();
  var randomNumber = m.random();
  
  You can also call the other genrand_{foo}() methods on the instance.

  If you want to use a specific seed in order to get a repeatable random
  sequence, pass an integer into the constructor:

  var m = new MersenneTwister(123);

  and that will always produce the same random sequence.

   A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.

   Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)  
   or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
