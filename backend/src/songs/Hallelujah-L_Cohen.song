{"titleSpace":0.5}

S: I've [C]heard there was a [Ami]secret chord 
That [C]David played, and it [Ami]pleased the Lord 
But [F]you don't really [G]care for music, [C]do you? [_G] 
It [C]goes like this The [F]fourth, the [G]fifth 
The [Ami]minor fall, the [F]major [G]lift 
The baffled king com[E]posing Halle[Ami]lujah 

R: Halle[F]lujah, Halle[Ami]lujah 
Halle[F]lujah, Halle[C]lu-uu[G]uu-u[C]jah

S: Your faith was strong but you needed proof 
You saw her bathing on the roof 
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you 
She tied you 
To a kitchen chair 
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair 
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
R:

S: Baby, I've been here before. 
I know this room, I've walked this floor. 
I used to live alone before I knew you. 
I've seen your flag on the marble arch, 
Love is not a victory march, 
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.
R:

S: [C]Maybe there's a [Ami]God above, 
but [C]all I've ever [Ami]learn from love 
Was [F]how to shoot some[G]body who out[C]drew you. [_G]
but it's [C]not a cry that you [F]hear to[G]night, 
It's [Ami]not somebody who's [F]seen the [G]light
It's a cold and itâ€™s a [E]broken Halle[Ami]lujah
R: [F Ami F C G C]Hallelujah...

S: There was a time that you let me now
What's really going on bellow
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove she was moving too
And every single breath that we drew was Hallelujah
R:

S: You say: "I took the name in vain"
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
R:

S: I did my best, but it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth
I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
R: x3
