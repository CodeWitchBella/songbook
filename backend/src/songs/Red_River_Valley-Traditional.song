Red River Valley
o

S: From this [D]valley they [D7]say you are [G]going 
I shall [D]miss your bright [H7]eyes and sweet [Emi A] smile 
for they [D]say you are [D7]taking the [G]sunshine 
That has [D]brighten my [A7]pathway a [D]while.

S: Come and sit by my side if you love me 
Do not hasten to bid me adieu 
Just remember the red river valley 
And the cowboy who has loved you so true.

S: For a long time, my darling, I've waited 
For the sweet words you never would say 
Now at last all my fond hopes have vanished 
For they say that you're going away
