CAPO 1
The [Am]snow glows white on the [F]mountain tonight
Not a [C]footprint to be [Dsus4 Dm]seen
A [Am]kingdom of iso[F]lation and it [G]looks like I'm the [Dsus4 D]queen
The [Am]wind is [F]howling like this [G]swirling storm in[Dsus4 Dm]side
[Am]Couldn't keep it [G]in, heaven knows I [D]tried

[G]Don't let them in, don't let them [F]see
Be the good girl you always have to [G]be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them [F]know
Well, now they [Fadd2]know

[F]Let it [C]go, let it [G]go
Can't [Am]hold it back any[F]more
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door

[C]I don't [G]care what they're [C]going to [F]say
Let the [G]storm rage on
The [F]cold never bothered me anyway

It's [Am]funny how some [C]distance
Makes [G]everything seem [Dm]small
And the [Am]fears that once con[G]trolled me
Can't [D]get to me at all

--- page break ---

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry

Here I stand and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on

[F]My power flurries through the air into the ground
[F]My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
[G]And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
[Am]I'm never [F]going back, the [G]past is in the [Dm F]past

Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone

Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
